Pig Game: A Simple Dice Game

Description:
Pig Game is a classic dice game where players take turns rolling a die. The goal is to accumulate the highest score without rolling a 1. If a 1 is rolled, the player's current score is lost, and their turn ends. Players can choose to "hold" their current score at any time, adding it to their total score and ending their turn. The first player to reach a predetermined score wins the game.
